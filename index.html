Welcome to my webpage! I was born in the north of Iran, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilan_province"><u>Gilan province</u></a>, 
where you see the pictures here. Gilan province contains sandy Caspian Sea beach and also green mountains as you see in my pictures. 
I am currently Associate Professor at 
<a href="http://english.xao.ac.cn/"><u>Xinjiang Astronomical Observatory(XAO) and Chinese Academy of Sciences(CAS)</u></a>,
Urumqi, China.
I was postdoctoral researcher at the School of Astronomy, Institute for research in Fundamental Sciences (also known as IPM), Tehran, Iran. Also, I won fellowship of
Center for International Science and Technology Interactions and a separate research grant for 14 months during my postdoctoral period at IPM. I was working in group of 
<a href="https://ipm.ac.ir/personalinfo.jsp?PeopleCode=IP1800047"><u>Prof Fatemeh Tabatabaei</u></a>. 
I am simulating radio data for SKA.
Before this position, I was postdoctoral fellow at National Astronomical Observatories of China and Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, with fellowship from China postdoctoral foundation. I worked in group of 
<a href="http://sourcedb.naoc.cas.cn/en/enaoexpert/200907/t20090706_2000324.html"><u>Prof Youjun Lu</u></a> 
 at NAOC/CAS. 
For my PhD, I studied at Department of Physics of Fudan University, Shanghai, China with CSC scholarship under supervision of
<a href="https://cosimobambi.github.io/"><u>Prof Cosimo Bambi</u></a>. 
My research was mainly about testing general relativity with electromagnetic radiation.
I also was postgraduate diploma student of The Abdus Salam ICTP, Trieste, Italy, after my master studies. I studied the cosmological dark matter power spectrum as a small project under supervision of
<a href="https://www.ictp.it/phonebook/person?id=2569"><u>Prof Paolo Creminelli</u></a>. 
My master and bachelor studies were in Tehran and Zanjan city of Iran, respectively. My master thesis was under supervision of 
<a href="https://ipm.ac.ir/personalinfo.jsp?PeopleCode=IP0800026"><u>Prof Hassan Firouzjahi</u></a>
about the methods of delta-N formalism in models of cosmic inflation and non-Gaussian perturbations.
